Customers may be cautious to interact with shared, public devices and opt for their own personal devices to apply for financing in-store. As retailers begin shifting their processes online, it is necessary to provide consumers with consistent shopping experiences both in-store and online while ensuring all shoppers are receiving the same comprehensive financing options. Versatile Credit is equipped to assist retailers in evaluating the effect enhanced consumer (and employee) concerns about safeguarding personal health may have on their sales financing programs through a suite of contactless self-service, remote sales and eCommerce options.'
