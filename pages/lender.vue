            Once lenders are integrated into the Versatile platform there is no
            need to integrate directly with retailers, reducing development
            costs and time to market. Partners are immediately integrated with
            our expansive lender network and technology ecosystem.

            The flexibility of Versatileâ€™s platform empowers lenders to offer
